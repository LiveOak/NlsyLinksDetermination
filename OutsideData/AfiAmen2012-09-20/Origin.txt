I’ll wait until tomorrow then for the males.  I have plenty of other stuff to work on.  Thanks for the good explanations.

The AFM data and AFI data I worked on recently was for Gen2.  
 
I have these for Gen1 from my thesis, but I only have AFI set up for females (male and female questions were separately listed in the NLSY questions list), I can give you the female only data set now (attached). I'll just give you those variables, the other variables I have in that data set are not likely to be useful (items like how many years they lived with each parent).
