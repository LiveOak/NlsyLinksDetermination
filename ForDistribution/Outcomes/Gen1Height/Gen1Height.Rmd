# Calculating Gen2 Height
This sequence picks a single height value per Gen2 subject.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F} 
#Set the chunks' working directory to the repository's base directory; this assumes the report is nested inside of two directories.
opts_knit$set(root.dir='../../../')  #Don't combine this call with any other chunk -espeically one that uses file paths.
```

```{r SetOptions, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
options(width=80)
opts_chunk$set(
  comment="", 
  warning=TRUE, 
  echo=TRUE, 
  tidy=FALSE, 
  size="small"
  )
read_chunk("./ForDistribution/Outcomes/Gen1Height/Gen1Height.R") #This allows knitr to call chunks tagged in the underlying .R file.
```


```{r LoadPackages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
## Define the age cutoffs to keep ages within the same Window as Gen1 Heights.  Define the height cutoffs to exclude values that are more likely to be entry errors or a developmental disorder, than a true reflection of additive genetics
```{r DefineGlobals}
```

## Load the appropriate information from the SQL Server database
```{r LoadData}
```

## Make necessary Adjustments
```{r TweakData}
```

## Combine the feet and inches to get total inches.  
```{r CalculateTotalInches, fig.height=2, cache=TRUE}
```

## Show the height data with age of the subject when the height was taken.  Filter out records where the age or the height is outside of the desired window.
```{r FilterValuesAndAges, fig.height=5, cache=TRUE}
```
## Standardize by Gender & Age.  Calculated Age (using SurveyDate and MOB) has been truncated to integers.  
```{r Standarize, fig.height=2, cache=TRUE}
```

## Determine Z-score to clip at.  Adjust as necessary (zMin & zMax were defined at the top of the page).  The white box extends between zMin and zMax.
```{r DetermineZForClipping, fig.height=5, cache=TRUE}
```

## Pick the subject's oldest record (within that age window).  Then examine the age & Z values
```{r ReduceToOneRecordPerSubject, fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8, cache=TRUE} 
```

## Compare with Kelly's height values.  

Make sure they roughly agree. There are a few differences, including (1) the age range is a little shifted, (2) the 2010 survey wasn't available, (3) the cutoff scores were more generous, and (4) the order of standardization & clipping *might* have been different.
```{r ComparingWithKelly, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, cache=TRUE} 
```

## Write the OutcomeData to CSV
```{r WriteToCsv } 
```
