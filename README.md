## Welcome to the algorithm side of the NLSY Kinship Linking Effort

This repository contains the C# code that manipulates the NLSY data to produce the relatedness values.  If you're only interested in the R package, then you want the [`NlsyLinks`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/) package.  If you want to see development versions of the R package, please see our [development repository](https://github.com/LiveOak/NlsyLinks) on GitHub.  Our support forums are located on [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/forum/?group_id=1330/)

For additional information about the package and using it in NLSY research, please see our [website](http://liveoak.github.io/NlsyLinks/), that is programming-language-agnostic.
 
Please read [this page from another project](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/RedcapExample/blob/master/README.md) to help you get started.  If you have questions, please contact Will.
